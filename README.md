# Bank Direct Marketing

## Overview
This repository contains the data and code for analyzing the Bank Direct Marketing Dataset. The project is divided into two main parts, each of which focuses on different aspects of the data analysis process.

### A1 - Data Exploration and Preprocessing
In this section, we focus on exploring the dataset to gain insights and understand the structure of the data. This includes:
- Descriptive statistics.
- Identifying data types and missing values.
- Perform data preprocessing for data quality and integrity.
- Visualizing key patterns and relationships within the dataset.

For a more detailed explanation, please refer to the **A1 - Data Exploration Report.pdf** file included in the repository.

### A2 - Data Mining and Modeling Pipeline
The second phase focuses on applying data mining techniques. In this phase, we:
- Experiment with multiple machine learning models (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc.).
- Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
- Evaluate models based on various metrics to determine the best-performing model.
